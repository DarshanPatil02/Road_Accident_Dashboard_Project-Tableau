**Road Accident Dashboard Project in Tableau**

Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and track road accident data in the UK for the year 2022. The dashboard provides insights into various metrics, including total accidents, casualties, and fatality trends, while enabling comparisons with the previous year. Key features include:

1. **Overall Metrics**: Displayed statistics for Total Accidents, Total Casualties, Fatal Casualties, Serious Casualties, and Slight Casualties, with year-over-year (YoY) percentage changes.
2. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - Casualties categorized by **Vehicle Type**, such as cars, bicycles, and trucks.
   - Impact of **Weather Conditions** (Rain, Snow, Fog, etc.) and **Road Surfaces** (Dry, Wet, Frost) on slight casualties.
   - Casualties by **Road Surface Type**, including single carriageways and roundabouts.
3. **Geographic Distribution**: Mapped slight casualties across the UK using a heatmap for regional insights.

This dashboard helps policymakers and transportation authorities identify patterns, prioritize safety measures, and enhance road infrastructure planning.
